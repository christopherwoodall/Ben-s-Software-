# Ben's Accessibility Software

## Overview

This project enhances accessibility for individuals with physical challenges, such as Ben, who has TUBB4a-related Leukodystrophy. Ben uses a two-button system for navigation and communication. This software integrates with his setup to:

- Provide scan-and-select capabilities.
- Open specific links to favorite shows.
- Include a menu for quick phrases.
- Track and update URLs dynamically.
- Offer emergency, settings, communication, and entertainment functions.
- Consolidate communication features into `keyboard.py`, eliminating the need for a separate communication menu.

## Features

### Navigation

- **Spacebar (Single Press)**: Advances forward by one item.
- **Spacebar (Held for More Than 3 Seconds)**: Continuously scans backward.
- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Works similarly to the main navigation.
  - Holding the `Return` key for more than 3 seconds jumps directly to predictive text for quicker word selection.

### Controls

- **Emergency Function**: Triggers an alert for immediate assistance.
- **Settings Menu**:
  - Volume Up/Down
  - Sleep Timer (60 minutes)
  - Cancel Sleep Timer
  - Turn Display Off
  - Lock Computer
  - Restart Computer
  - Shut Down Computer
- **Quick Phrase Method**: Integrated into the keyboard’s layout menu.
- **Predictive Text**: Allows faster and more intuitive text entry.
- **Chrome Auto-Close**: Chrome minimizes or closes when needed. To close Chrome using the buttons, press `Enter-Enter-Enter`.
- **On-Screen Keyboard**:
  - Includes volume up and volume down button controls.
  - Predictive text shortcut via long `Return` press.

### Entertainment

- **Dynamic Show Tracking**: Automated via `shows.xlsx`. Populate the file with `type`, `genre`, `title`, and `URL`. Works best with:
  - Plex
  - Spotify
  - Netflix
  - Hulu
  - Disney+
  - Paramount+
  - YouTube
  - HBO Max
- **Trivia Mode**:
  - Pulls trivia data from `trivia_questions.xlsx`.
  - Populate with `category`, `question`, and `answers`, and the software auto-categorizes.
- **Games Menu**:
  - `concentration.py`: A memory game.
  - `tictactoe.py`: Classic Tic Tac Toe.
  - More games coming soon, including Golf, Hangman, and Text Adventures.
- **Pause Menu**: Holding down the `Return` key for more than six seconds opens a pause window.

## Future Enhancements

- **More Games**: Golf, Hangman, and text-based adventures.
- **Virtual Pet**: A "Tamagotchi"-style pet for Ben to feed and interact with.
